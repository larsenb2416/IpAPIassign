# IpAPIassign
Challenges you ran into during the project
I could not figure out how to get the site working. I got the code to work and get my ip but vercel didnt get my source code. It was also difficult to choose the best API

What you learned during the project
I learned to build a python file that can read an API!

Overview of the backlog items you created.
I created a comment to add more to the code and site

Speculate why you see a different IP address when running the code locally vs viewing the Vercel website.
Because they are using different source IPs therefore gathering different information
